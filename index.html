					<p class="p2">Everyone can see the adorable Disney Seven Treasures at Hong Kong Disney land and Shanghai Disney Resort.
						You can watch parades of floats, shows see your favorite characters while visiting Disneyland. Also, you can interact with your favorite characters in the Disneyland queue where you can hug and take pictures with them.
					</p>
					<p class="p2">
						Below are real heartwarming comments from visitors who have interacted with characters:

                    <p class="p2">
					I was so excited to go and interact with LinaBell for the first time. It's been more than three years, since Ling Na Belle first came to Disney, she began to be positively attracted by her, and every day when I see the baby, I feel like it's my own little sun, and sometimes I'm also amused by her playfulness. I never found the opportunity to come to Shanghai to see her, but I was really touched to finally meet her today.
					I went to see the float parade in the daytime and the Christmas lighting and winter parade in the evening. When the Christmas tree lights were on, I saw Linnaeus actively jumping under the tree for more than 10 minutes, and I couldn't help but be moved to tears. The last few minutes to pick up Ling Na Bei from work, feel that today are complete, looking at the baby almost 8 o'clock is still working overtime to provide full of emotional value to all visitors will really love and heartbreaking. I hope my baby actress will always be so cute and sunny and continue to bring some light to this awful world.
